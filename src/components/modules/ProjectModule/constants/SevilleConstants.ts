  title: "What is Seville?",
  summary: "Seville is a Unity plugin designed to simplify and speed up VR content development with less or no code. During my internship at Smarteye.id by Telkom Indonesia, I was given a task to create all designs for Seville’s UI assets and the landing page website of Seville. The landing page consisted information of Seville including features, the highlight of what makes Seville special, contacts, and all about Seville. The purposes is so people discover and understand Seville. I also made Seville’s UI assets and marketing design needs, such as merchandise, posters, banners, a few video assets, and instagram posts.",

I also searched Seville's competitor (other plugins, VR UI package, etc) to see what they've got as a benchmark and a competitor analysis. For the design system, I studied the existing design system that Smarteye has and implemented it on the landing page.",
            "The same thing for Seville's design needs, I concepted the branding and set standardization for all of the designs coming out for Seville."

The results showed that most participants understood what Seville is and could explain it back to me accurately. However, I received some feedback, including the need to emphasize that Seville works with Unity and to provide clearer explanations about the differences between Seville's three templates / starter project."
